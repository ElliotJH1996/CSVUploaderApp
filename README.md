This project was created/inspired by previous tasks completed for various assignments/projects, the concept of the task was a colaboration of both myself and other members of the development team, this later became a techincal assessment for future developers wishing to join the company.

This repository is my individual ongoing solution for the task mentioned above, I have been updating this application frequently over time to include new functionality to both improve the quality of the application and also my own learning.

Small brief of task:
You are asked to create 3 applications, an ASP.NET core Web App, a console application and a DB application. The purpose of these applications is to upload data from a CSV file and insert that data into correlating database tables, the Web app application consumes an API endpoint which handles the database queries/inserts; this functionality is shared between the web app and console application.
The following criteria must be met:
-	The file must be submitted directly to API via web app, it cannot go through the controller first.
-	Any data parsing must be programmed manually; no libraries are allowed to perform this task. 
-	Web app should notify user when data insertion has concluded, they should also be notified if an issue occurs during this process. 
-	Web app errors should be stored in database table as well as being presented to the user.
-	Any design pattern is allowed for this task.
