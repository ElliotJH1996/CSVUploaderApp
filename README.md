This project was created/inspired by previous tasks completed for various assignments/projects, this later became a techincal assessment for future developers wishing to join the company.

I have been updating this application frequently over time to include new functionality to both improve the quality of the application and also my own learning.
Many areas of this project were new to me when I started and I aim to improve on these over time.

Small brief of task:
You are asked to create 3 applications, an ASP.NET core Web App, a console application and a DB application. The purpose of these applications is to upload data from a CSV file and insert that data into correlating database tables, the Web app application consumes an API endpoint which handles the database queries/inserts; this functionality is shared between both applications.
The following criteria must be met:
-	The file must be submitted directly to API via web app, it cannot go through the controller first.
-	Any data parsing must be programmed manually; no libraries are allowed to perform this task. 
-	Web app should notify user when data insertion has concluded, they should also be notified if an issue occurs during this process. 
-	Web app errors should be stored in database table as well as being presented to the user.
-	Any design pattern is allowed for this task.
